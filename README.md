# Ender-3V2-Config
This is for my Ender 3V2 Klipper config.
Please review https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html for more Klipper information.

This config is for a BL Touch mounted on the left side.
Settings may need to be tweaked per printer.

I'm not responsible for any damages you may incur using these settings on your 3D Printer.
